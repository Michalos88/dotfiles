### Color Schemes

The default color scheme is [Smyck](https://github.com/hukl/Smyck-Color-Scheme/), which looks best with the [corresponding terminal theme](https://github.com/hukl/Smyck-Color-Scheme/) installed as well.

### Font

Using one of the following fonts is recommended: https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts. Right now, I use Inconsolata. On iTerm2, you may have to make the size of "Non-ASCII Font" smaller than the size of "Regular Font" in order to ensure everything lines up in your powerline. I typically use 12pt for "Regular" and 10pt for "Non-ASCII".
